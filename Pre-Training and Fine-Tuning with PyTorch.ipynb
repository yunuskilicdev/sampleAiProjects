    "Estimated time needed: **60** minutes\n",

    "As a machine learning engineer working for a streaming site, your objective is to develop a recommender system based on written movie reviews. Given that the dataset for these reviews is relatively small, your strategy leverages a larger, accessible dataset of magazine articles. The plan is to pretrain the model on this expansive magazine dataset to capture a broad understanding of text and language patterns. Subsequently, the model will undergo fine-tuning on the smaller, specific dataset of movie reviews to adapt its learned features to the particular task of recommending movies.\n",

    "Fine-tuning a pretrained model can be approached in several ways, each with its advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training the model on the small movie dataset:**\n",
    "   - **Advantages:** Directly training on the movie review data ensures that the model is highly specialized and tailored to the specific characteristics and nuances of the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages:** Due to the small size of the dataset, the model is at a higher risk of overfitting. There might not be enough data to effectively capture all of the complexities of language and sentiment in movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pretraining the model on a larger general-domain text and fine-tuning the movie dataset for each parameter:**\n",
    "   - **Advantages:** This approach allows every part of the model to learn from the movie reviews, potentially improving its accuracy on the specific task.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages:** Fine-tuning all parameters with a small dataset can still lead to overfitting. It also requires huge computational resources and time, as adjustments across all parameters might lead to numerous iterations of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fine-tuning on the final layer only:**\n",
    "   - **Advantages:** Fine-tuning only the final layer reduces the risk of overfitting, as the bulk of the model retains its pretrained structure. This method is faster and less resource-intensive.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages:** Because only the final layer is adjusted, the model might not fully adapt to the specifics of the movie reviews, potentially limiting its effectiveness in understanding deeper contextual nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method offers a balance between adapting to the specifics of the movie review dataset and maintaining the robustness and generalizability learned from the larger magazine article dataset. Choosing the right strategy depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project, such as available computational resources, the urgency of deployment, and the desired accuracy and specificity of the recommender system.\n"

    "## IMDB dataset overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **IMDB dataset** contains movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) and is commonly used for binary sentiment classification tasks. It's a popular dataset for training and testing models in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in the context of sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset composition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reviews**: The dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews, divided evenly into 25,000 training and 25,000 testing samples.\n",
    "- **Sentiment labels**: Each review is labeled as either positive or negative, indicating the sentiment expressed in the review. The dataset is balanced, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews in both the training and testing sets.\n",
    "- **Text content**: Reviews are presented as plain text and have been preprocessed to some extent. For example, HTML tags are removed, but the text retains its original punctuation and capitalization.\n",
    "- **Usage**: The dataset is commonly used to train models for binary sentiment classification, where the goal is to predict whether a given review is positive or negative based on its text content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment analysis**: The primary application of the IMDB dataset is in sentiment analysis, where it serves as a benchmark for various text classification algorithms.\n",
    "- **Natural language processing (NLP)**: The dataset is widely used in NLP research and applications, providing a basis for testing the effectiveness of different models and approaches in understanding human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is small, so it's hard to train a model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following class is defined to traverse the IMDB dataset. The need to define this class arises from the fact that the IMDB dataset is split across a large number of files.\n"

      "(0, 'The main reasons to see \"Red Eye\" are Rachel McAdams, who delivers a stellar performance, and Jayma Mays, who is wonderful as the Assistant Hotel Manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy overacts so badly that he becomes cartoonish. The rest of the movie is riddled with plot holes, on which I will elaborate.<br /><br />Please do not read further if you don\\'t want to know what happens!<br /><br />Here is a synopsis of the plot. Rachel McAdams\\'s character (Lisa) manages a hotel where the new hard-nosed Homeland Security Director plans to stay that night. Rachel is returning to Miami from a funeral, but fielding calls from her assistant up until the plane leaves. In the meantime, someone is stationed outside the house of her father, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him if Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All Lisa has to do is phone the hotel and move the Director\\'s suite to one where Jackson\\'s cohorts are planning to fire a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the Director and his family.<br /><br />So, here are some of the plot holes or absurd coincidences:<br /><br />1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make the call, and in the middle, the phones in the plane lose their connection. Lisa tries to fake that she is making the call, but coincidentally, a guy across the aisle from Jackson is also making a call and starts banging his phone to indicate it is dead. Jackson catches on and grabs the phone from Lisa.<br /><br />2. At one point, Jackson head-butts Lisa and she, of course, gets knocked out...but only for 30 minutes.<br /><br />3. Jackson catches Lisa writing a note on the mirror in the (extraordinarily large) lavatory, and he bangs her around a bit. Miraculously, the only one who hears anything is an 11-year-old girl, whose word, of course, is discounted.<br /><br />4. Lisa stabs Jackson with a pen in the throat as the plane is landing, steals his cell phone, and makes a mad dash for the exit, fitting down the aisle between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. Despite knowing there is a passenger with a pen stuck in his throat, the flight attendants oblige Lisa by opening the door to the jet-way.<br /><br />5. OK, all those are reasonable (if not highly unlikely). But here\\'s where it gets really stupid. Lisa gets into the terminal at Miami Airport, and there is no cell phone signal (every major airport in America has great cell phone reception).<br /><br />6. She runs through the airport with Jackson in hot pursuit, and no security officers even delay them.<br /><br />7. Jackson, who lost Lisa in the Airport while the train from the gates pulled away to the terminal, has lost some of his voice from the pen in his throat, but he can still be somewhat understood. However, he doesn\\'t bother to call his man outside of Joe\\'s house. (PS: There is no train at Miami Airport, but the one they showed looked an awful lot like the Orlando Airport).<br /><br />8. Lisa steals a car and rides away. Of course this time, when she goes to make a call, the cell phone says \"low battery\" and soon shuts off (when will they stop using this inane plot device?).<br /><br />9. While the phone still said \"low battery,\" Lisa had reached her assistant just in time to save the Director and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the room on the 40th floor to which the Director had been moved. Of course, they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by ocean, so the missile could have probably been launched at the first suite, thereby negating the need for the whole Lisa-Jackson plot. What\\'s the story here? Was the Director\\'s original room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a lousy view? Nevertheless, everyone gets out just before the missile hits.<br /><br />10. Lisa drives to Joe\\'s house to save her father only to see the killer outside. Although she runs him over (as he is shooting at her) by crashing her Jeep into the house, no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop by.<br /><br />11. Jackson arrives at Joe\\'s house and knocks him out (we don\\'t see how...maybe another head butt). He then explains to Lisa that he didn\\'t kill dad yet because he wanted dad to see Lisa die first (Give me a break. What is this? Saturday morning cartoons?).<br /><br />12. For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson chases Lisa around the house, and she resourcefully fights him off. Of course a real killer (i.e. one maybe played by Jason Statham) would have done away with Lisa (or for that matter anyone who is not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds. During the course of this chase, Jackson steps over Joe at least once without bothering to kill him.<br /><br />13. Finally, Jackson prevails, and he is about to kill Lisa when (you guessed it) he is shot by Joe.<br /><br />So, here\\'s my suggestion...tell Wes Craven to stick to horror. Or maybe he should get together with Michael Bay (who directed the equally stupid \"The Island\") and make \"Red Island.\"')\n",

      "(0, \"An MTV-style film crew consisting of American T.V. programme producer Zack Zardine (Matt Borlenghi) his camerawoman, the Australian Cecily (Kate Fisher) and two surfer 'dudes' named Bog Hall (Dax Miller) and Jeremy (Joel West) arrive on some nice looking island somewhere, it's not actually revealed where. The crew plan to shoot an expose on 'bloodsurfing' which is apparently the latest craze in extreme sports. Surfers throw bait into the sea and cut themselves to attract sharks, just to see if they can out-surf them without being eaten. Once there they are greeted by Sonny Lofranco (Cris Vertido) and his wife Melba (Susan Africa). Their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark infested waters of Lilo-Cay. Sonny, Melba and their daughter Lemmya (Maureen Larrazabal) take them in their boat. Soon after arriving and having already shot some 'bloodsurfing' footage Sonny, Melba and Lemmya are all killed by a 30 foot saltwater crocodile that some say 'owns' the island. The boat is sunk. Zack, Cecily, Bog and Jeremy appear stuck on the island until such time a rescue party arrives. However, after a run in with some, erm well I don't really know what they are. Pirates? Drug smugglers? Revolutionairies? Fat ugly people who just don't like being with other people? Who knows? And more importantly who cares? Not me that's for sure. Anyway, after escaping from these guys who look like pirates, they are picked up just off the coast of the island by Captain John Dirks (Duncan Regehr) and his girl Arty (Taryn Reif as Tara Reif). The film crew believe they have been saved. Little do they know that the crocodile and Captain Dirks go way back and he has a score to settle and four members of a film crew aren't going to stop him. Captain Dirks heads back to Lilo-Cay for a final showdown with the giant man-eating crocodile.<br /><br />Directed by James D.R. Hickox this is one awful film, but it's still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers Crocodile (2000). Everything about this film sucks. The script by Sam Bernard and Robert L.Levy is terrible, extremely slow as the crocodile isn't even seen or mentioned before the 30 minute mark and by that time I was seriously bored and annoyed with the hideously unlikeable characters thought up by Bernard and Levy. The whole film is also frustratingly predictable as well, within the first 10 minutes anyone familiar with horror film stereotypes and stock characters will be able to guess who dies and who will survive. The crocodile effects are awful and seem to be repeated over and over, there is a small puppet head that obviously has someones arm stuck inside it controlling it's movements as the water splashes become huge! The CGI shots of the crocodile are just plain embarrassing to watch. There is no gore apart from when a character is bitten in half which is achieved using CGI to digitally remove the actors legs, again it looks terrible. There is also a brief scene when someone is impaled on wooden spikes when they set a trap off. There is a reasonable amount of nudity and sex, plus the female actresses are nice and easy on the eye. There are basic continuity and logical errors in the film too, in one sequence Cecily is filming Bog and Jeremy 'bloodsurfing' but from the angle and distance she is at it would be physically impossible to obtain footage of both the sharks and surfers at the same time, and surely that is the whole point of her shot? When Dirks manages to harpoon the crocodile the angle of the wire changes dramatically between shots, in one shot the angle of the line looks like it's coming from the sky, in the shot straight after the angle is completely different and it seems as if the line is coming from below the surface of the water when in actual fact the harpoon is attached to the back of the boat and the line should be almost level with the surface. I could carry on, like why does the crocodile jump off the edge of a cliff if it's so smart as this film tries to make out? But I would probably exceed the 1000 word limit if I listed everything that was wrong with this film, so I won't. I hated this film, but rather scarily it's still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers effort at a giant crocodile film. Definitely one to avoid.\")\n",

      "(0, 'What of Domino did I hate over everything, and I mean everything, else? Perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter; maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character; maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like Lucy Lui; who deserves a lot better than this junk; and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face. Maybe it\\'s the editing; that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they\\'re uttered by people like Kiera Knightly who, if you buy as a bounty hunter, then you\\'ll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012.<br /><br />Nobody comes away from Domino with any sort credibility, absolutely nobody at all. It is a painful and misguided experience, taking inspiration from things like Natural Born Killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them. The principal question is: \\'Was Domino supposed to be some kind of comedy?\\' what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she\\'s coming across as \\'tough\\' but really, she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school, attempting to impress her peers. There are things you genuinely don\\'t know how to react to, whether they\\'re supposed to be funny or not. If it is supposed to be a comedy, that begs the next question: \\'Is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs?\\' I don\\'t think so.<br /><br />The film opens with the title card \\'Based on a true story........sort of.\\' If that\\'s supposed to be some sort of post-modernist technique that enables director Tony Scott to bend and manipulate the story of Domino Harvey for his own unique purpose, then you\\'re simply on another planet. Truth is, in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying \\'sort of\\' which I guess is supposed to enable them to make Domino older than she should be and appear on Jerry Springer. Following this, we learn of Domino\\'s relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something; here is the first use of the \\'sort of\\' cop out as in real life she was just four. But if the film had gone by reality\\'s dates then her entire drive would\\'ve been born out of the death of........her goldfish.<br /><br />We are then thrust into action with Ed Mosbey (Rourke); Domino (Knightley) herself and would-be love interest Choco (Ramírez). During the scene, an American mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son\\'s life to be spared. What a really misguided opening; presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers, fire off weapons at innocents we don\\'t know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs.<br /><br />The immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads, a feeling of \\'No, why are you doing this? Why is this happening?\\' Bad seeds are planted and, wouldn\\'t you know it, they stick. The film is painful to watch, excruciating even; as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in Beverly Hills 90210. Here is another daft post-modernist slant, people playing themselves and that \\'sort of\\' Joker card being played again. Christopher Walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of Robert Downey Jr\\'s Natural Born Killers character.<br /><br />So as the film plods on and Domino is cast into Ed and Choco\\'s gang, purely for her good looks I might add, it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver\\'s registration I.Ds or something that Choco and Domino may have feelings for one another. The problem is, as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character; there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two; the film isn\\'t a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place? Does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up? If there is any \\'feeling\\' between Choco and Domino, it exists on such a small, tiny, minimalist scale that you have to ask why it\\'s even included.<br /><br />So then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative-wise. We find out the reason for the fake I.Ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble. The sound proof bubble I can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded? He must\\'ve swam really quickly \\x96 double the speed of the film\\'s fasted edit which means something in the region of .01 of a second. Yeah, sure. The film\\'s story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up. Plus, there\\'s a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film\\'s comedy runs SO dry, that it has to resort to the \"Jerry, Jerry!\" chant whilst people are on a popular American talk show.

His scenes with Earl Holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with Earl's request for some home spirits are very funny.<br /><br />Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar, but lost to The Ten Commandments and the parting of the Red Sea. Forbidden Planet's bad luck to run up against a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille.<br /><br />Classicists among you will recognize Forbidden Planet as a futuristic reworking of The Tempest which when you think about it could have been Shakespeare's one venture into science fiction. <br /><br />My favorite among the cast is Warren Stevens who's sacrifice enables Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with.<br /><br />Never miss this one whenever it's broadcast.\")\n",
      "(1, 'Love the characters and the story line. Very funny with plenty of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great performances. I enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very likable, and surprisingly sympathetic, burnt out hit man. All three actors are among my favorites and having them in this movie made for a special treat. A nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. If you like... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, L.A. Confidential, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and, The Whole Nine Yards... you will love this movie.')\n",
      "(1, 'It\\'s about an embezzler, Peter Ustinov, who infiltrates a British company, Texa-Conn or something like that, posing as a computer whiz and security expert. He secretly learns to hack into the computer, while gathering the admiration of his boss, Karl Malden, the enmity of his office rival, Bob Newhart, and the love of his inept secretary, Maggie Smith.<br /><br />Some of the business details were a little murky to these non-business-oriented eyes but they\\'re believable enough and I got the general idea. Ustinov, the peculating Peter, establishes phony businesses in Paris, Rome, and Stuttgart, and uses Texa-Conn\\'s computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz establishments. The overseas companies, of course, consist of nothing more than himself, Ustinov, and the addresses are an abandoned artist\\'s loft in Paris, a barber shop in Rome, and a bakery in Germany. He simply visits them to collect the checks he\\'s sent himself.<br /><br />I didn\\'t think I\\'d like it for the first few minutes because it seemed rather on the slow side. I was expecting something with a faster tempo and more outrage, along the lines of \"The Pink Panther\" or \"The Lavender Hill Gang.\" But this film insinuates itself into your good graces as you come to appreciate the understated humor in the plot, the characterizations, and the dialog.<br /><br />Probably it would be a bad idea to give away too many of the relatively subtle gags but here are some examples of the more noticeable.<br /><br />Ustinov to Secretary Smith: \"Let me have the assets of these companies.\" Smith: \"Assets? What are they?\" Ustinov: \"Little female donkeys.\" Now, nothing is made of this little exchange. There\\'s a quick cut and no delay for any laughter, which is appropriate because one\\'s reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh.<br /><br />Ustinov searches out that crummy loft in Paris. It\\'s covered with cobwebs. Bricks are strewn around and a couple of the former occupant\\'s paintings have been left behind. The landlord doesn\\'t speak English and Ustinov knows no French. Ustinov points to a child-like painting of a nude woman and chuckles, \"Ah. A fam fye-tal, eh?\" Landlord chuckles too, replies: \"Vous le prenez pour une anee?\" Ustinov: \"Oh -- ANNIE, so that\\'s her name!\" Landlord: \"Oui?\" Ustinov: \"Entente cordiale!\" (Mes amis, if I got those genders wrong, je m\\'excuse.) Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole (!) has the hots for Maggie Smith and is supposed to be driving her home but tells her he\\'s taking \"the scenic route.\" There is an immediate sequence of suggestive traffic signs. \"Caution.\" \"Lay-By.\" \"Give Way.\" \"Yield.\" Ending with the imperious \"STOP/CHILDREN.\" There\\'s another montage when Ustinov\\'s scheme is about to be discovered by the board of directors -- blurry rooftops, police cars, a farewell embrace from Maggie, ending with a sign: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs.<br /><br />Well, maybe one more. I still can\\'t get over Malden as the boss, declaring decisively, \"I never agonize over decisions,\" then gulping a handful of pills and washing them down with a glass of water.<br /><br />The acting is unarguably fine. It\\'s Bob Newhart\\'s best role, for instance. Not that he had that many, and not that his range wasn\\'t limited, but he\\'s perfect in this part. The musical score by Laurie Johnson obviously had a good deal of effort put into it. She seems to have written a brief concerto for flute. Ustinov\\'s passion is music and his overseas establishments are headed by false names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. Stuttgart\\'s phony president is somebody named Schmidt, and he\\'s an anomalous clinker. Maggi Smith is pretty, sexy, bourgeois, and turns out to be not nearly so dumb as she seems.<br /><br />Delightful, in its own quiet way, but don\\'t expect comic fireworks.')\n",
      "(1, \"I saw this film at the International Film Festival Of Brussels. I also met the director of the film. I heard that Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thought his would be his masterpiece - his triumph.<br /><br />Well, if you take the film seriously (like mr. Wood did) it is really one of the worst films you will ever see. And this is cool. The big joke of I Woke Up Early The Day I Died is that it doesn't even try to be a decent film.<br /><br />This makes the film very, very good. The script is filled with nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humour. Billy Zane's role is absolutely excellent. You see, this is either high art...or low rubbish.<br /><br />****/*****\")\n",
      "(1, 'You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a US secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover Nazi secret and turn the tide of World War II. That means everything from breaking out of a Nazi dungeon to thwarting Hitler\\'s war machine and even the Fuhrer himself.<br /><br />This is quite possibly the most influential game of its time. That\\'s because it literally inspired obsession. Many games existed at the time and even more do today, but every so often you get a real grabber. This is one of them. Just like Tetris before it and more recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost every respect, but the shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming\\'s biggest tidal waves were fired by B.J. Blazkowicz. The Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at ID. Whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still do.<br /><br />Even with its old look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, games now border on the \"experience level\") and highly rectangular levels, the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun. Especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them.<br /><br />Also: \"Halt!\" *bang! bang! bang!* \"AARRRGH!!!\" never grows old. --- 8/10<br /><br />Voluntarily rated PC-13 for \"profound carnage.\" However, it\\'s exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today.')\n",
      "(1, 'Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins would shake the world of the Christian subculture (and make millions in the process) with the LEFT BEHIND books, MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of the Billy Graham evangelistic association, gave us this masterwork. What I love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail, sitting in a living room. Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this \"post-rapture\" tribulation, we sit in the living room, hearing about it on the news because the filmmakers can\\'t afford to show it. The film\\'s premise is grounded in Pre-Millenial, pre-Tribulation eschatalogy, believing that Christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church, and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth. What used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh. The intriguing adventures of Patty and her journey throughout the tribulation (and two of the film\\'s three sequels) tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation. I hate to admit it, but I still thoroughly enjoy watching this. It even has the SAME EXACT score of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I\\'m the only person in history to make that observation.')\n",
      "(1, 'While a pleasant enough musical, what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as the has-been composer, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Playing a high strung, distracted artistic type (a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone\\'s character looks like he couldn\\'t find his way out of bed without help. And that help is Starbuck, played with his usual droll humor by Oscar Levant. Upon hiring Crosby\\'s character as his ghost song writer, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck by saying, \"He does all my thinking for me.\", to which Levant responds, \"Ah, it\\'s only a part-time job.\" Of course this goes right past (or over) Rathbone, who\\'s too busy fretting about where his next hit song will come from. As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone could be so funny! Too bad he didn\\'t have more opportunities to display his comedic talent.')\n"

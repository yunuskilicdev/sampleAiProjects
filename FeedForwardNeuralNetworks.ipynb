    "\n",
    "This project explores the use of Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) in language modeling. The primary objective is to build a neural network that learns word relationships and generates meaningful text sequences. The implementation is done using PyTorch, covering key aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as:\n",
    "* Tokenization & Indexing: Converting text into numerical representations.\n",
    "* Embedding Layers: Mapping words to dense vector representations for efficient learning.\n",
    "* Context-Target Pair Generation (N-grams): Structuring training data for sequence prediction.\n",
    "* Multi-Class Neural Network: Designing a model to predict the next word in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process includes optimizing the model with loss functions and backpropagation techniques to improve accuracy and coherence in text generation. By the end of the project, you will have a working FNN-based language model capable of generating text sequences.\n",

    "Perplexity is a measurement used to evaluate the effectiveness of language models or probability models. It provides an indication of how well a model predicts a sample of data or the likelihood of an unseen event. Perplexity is commonly used in natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, speech recognition, and language generation.\n",
